# SudokuSolver

The following program can solve 9x9 sudokus of any difficulty. 
Simply change the grid in the main method to your own grid.
It will also display if there exist a solution or not for the given grid

Possible future implementations: I might make a GUI, add the time it took for the algorithm 
    to solve the sudoku and, eventually, when I will be skilled enough, an AI reader that will be able 
    to scan a sudoku grid and solve it!!!
    
A few sample outputs:
